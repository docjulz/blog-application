# Blog Application
This blog application uses NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and a 3rd Party Middleware to create a blog.
This is based on a NodeJS training course by CodeNinja.  My goal was to learn practical applications of 
Node and will expand on this to create a more personalized blog using the skills learned throught that training.
